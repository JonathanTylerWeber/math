1. Why is it important to be able to convert vectors to angles in game development?
  a. Generally, being able to convert to angles can be important for doing things
  like determining an object’s orientation or implementing things like steering
  behaviours in a simple way.

2. Explain the terms magnitude and direction in the context of vectors.
  a. →
  Magnitude refers to the length or size of a vector, and is often denoted as ‖ 𝑣
  ‖.
  Direction describes the orientation of the vector.

3. What are polar coordinates, and how do they differ from Cartesian coordinates?
  a. Polar coordinates (r, θ) represent points in space using their distance “r” from
  the origin, and an angle θ with respect to the positive x-axis. Cartesian
  coordinates define points based on their horizontal and vertical distance from
  the origin.

4. Convert (3, 4) from Cartesian coordinates to polar coordinates.
  a. (5, 0.93 radians)

5. Convert (-1, 3) from Cartesian coordinates to polar coordinates.
  a. (3.16, 1.89 radians)

6. Convert (3,
  -2) from Cartesian coordinates to polar coordinates.
  a. (3.6,
  -0.59 radians)

7. Convert (1, π/2) from polar coordinates to Cartesian coordinates.
  a. (0, 1)

8. Convert (1, 0) from polar coordinates to Cartesian coordinates.
  a. (1, 0)

9. Convert (5, π/4) from polar coordinates to Cartesian coordinates.
  a. (3.53, 3.53)

10. Why do acos and asin fail to determine angles uniquely?
  a. Recall that cos(θ) can return the same value for 2 different angles. An easy
  example is cos(π/4) and cos(-π/4), and thus cannot uniquely identify an angle
  in the range [0, 2π]. The input to acos is restricted to work in the range [0, π].
  The function asin has a similar limitation, for example, sin(π/4) sin(3π/4) are
  the same, since asin is restricted to work in the range [-
  π
  2
  π
  , ].

11. What function would you normally use instead?
  a. atan2

12. Describe how storing a player’s orientation in polar coordinates may be advantageous
  over storing it as a vector in Cartesian coordinates.
  a. Storing the player’s orientation in polar coordinates may simplify rotations, as
  you can operate on the angle θ directly. Turning left or right is as simple as
  adding or subtracting from θ. Additionally, smoothly blending between
