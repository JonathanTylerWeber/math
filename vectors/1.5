vector addition is both associative and commutative

associativity:
grouping doesnt affect result
(a + b) + c = a + (b + c)

commutativity:
order doesnt affect result
a + b = b + a

vector subtraction is not associative or commutative

1. Is addition associative/commutative? Show an example.
   yes a + b = b + a

2. Subtraction? Show an example.
   no a - b != b - a

3. Multiplication? Show an example.
   yes a _ b = b _ a

4. Division? Show an example.
   no a / b != b / a
