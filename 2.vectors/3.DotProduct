Dot Product

- shows up in movement and lighting

takes 2 vectors, produces a scalar
  - also called scalar product, scalar projection

similarity of 2 vectors
  - how closely they align in direction

how to compute:
  dot(a, b) = value
  dot(a, b) = a.x * b.x + a.y * b.y

a = (1, 2), b = (1, 3)
  dot(a, b) = 1 * 1 + 2 * 3 = 7

also can be magnitude (length) of a * magnitude of b * cos(angle between a and b)
  related to the cosine of the angle between the 2 vectors, scaled by the magnitude of both

orthogonality is vectors that are perpendicular, 
  dot product is 0 and the vectors have no components in the same direction

vectors should be normalized to get dot product, direction vectors are generally normalized

for dot product 1 is same direction, -1 is opposite direction, and 0 is perpendicular

could be used to see if player is within enemy field of view 
  if enemy fov is 60deg, it's 30 on each side. so do cos(angle between where they're looking and player position), 
  if it's between 1 and cos(30) then the enemy can see the player

generally used to 
  relate the angle between 2 vectors and 
  project 1 vector onto another

7. Is the dot product associative? Show using any 2 vectors.
  no

8. Commutative? Again, show using any 2 vectors.
  yes

9. If v1 ⋅v2 = 0, what does this signify geometrically?
  the vectors are perpendicular/orthogonal

10. If v1 ⋅ v2 < 0, what does this signify geometrically?
  the angle between the vectors is greater than 90deg

11. As v1 ⋅ v2 approaches 1, what does this signify geometrically?
  the angle is growing smaller

12. Given v1 , and v2 , what is the possible range of values for v1 ⋅ v2 ? Why?
  -1 to 1, they should be normalized

13. How is the dot produced related to the angle between 2 unit vectors?
  The dot product of 2 unit vectors is related to the cosine of the angle
  between them.

14. What is the relationship between  𝑣1 ⋅𝑣1 and v| 1 |?
  The dot product of a vector with itself is equal to the square of the magnitude

15. Given 2 vectors, 𝑣1 and 𝑣2 , how would you determine if they’re orthogonal?
  if the dot product is 0

16. How would you use the dot product to implement a "lock-on" targeting system?
  So if you’re building a game and wanted to implement some sort of autolock
  or “lock on” system, whereby your targeting cursor immediately latches onto nearby
  targets, you could do something like this. You’d have your aiming direction, let’s call 
  that 𝑎 , and the vectors from the player to each enemy, call those vectors i , then this
  could be done by calculating the dot product between 𝑎 and i , filtering out anything
  that didn’t meet some predetermined minimum threshold, and then simply choosing
  the highest result. This would ensure that you’ve chosen the target nearest to the
  current targeting direction, and your game logic could adjust the target direction to
  exactly match.
