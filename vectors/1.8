distance in 2d

pythagorean theorem

C^2 = A^2 + B^2
where C is the hypotenuse (longest side), 90 degree angle between a and b

or also
c = sqrt(a^2 + b^2)

3d would be 
v = sqrt(x^2 + y^2 + z^2)

so to get the distance between two points, find the difference between them and then apply the formula

1. Compute the lengths of the following vectors:
  a. (2,0)
    2
  b. (0,3)
    3
  c. (3,4)
    5


2. Compute the distance between the following pairs of points:
  a. (3,4), (0,0)
    5
  b. (4,-5), (-4,5)
    12.8

3. Compute the length of the following 3D vector:
  a. (3,4,12)
    13
