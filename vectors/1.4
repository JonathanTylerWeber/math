   another vector

2. What do you get by adding 2 points?
   you wouldnt really do this unless to find the midpoint by then dividing by two

3. What do you get by adding a point and a vector?
   another point

4. What do you get by subtracting a vector from a point?
   another point

5. In a 1D space, if P1 is located at 4, and there is a direction vector of +7, where will the new point be?
   11

6. The temperature today at 9 am is 0°. By noon, it rises by 8°. What is the temperature at noon?
   8

7. Given two vectors: +6 and -3, what is their sum?
   3

8. Consider a point P at position 12. Add a direction vector of +5 to it. Where is the new point?
   17

9. If the temperature rises by 5° in the afternoon and then drops by 2° in the evening, what is the total change in temperature?
   3

10. Starting at point 0, apply the vectors +4, -7, and +3 sequentially. Where will you end up?
    0

11. If the temperature at 8 am is 7° and at 5 pm is 15°, what was the change in temperature?
    +8

12. Point A is at 20 and Point B is at 35. What is the direction vector from A to B?
    +15

13. Given two points: 25 and 18, find the direction vector from the first point to the second.
    -7

14. Point A is at 6. It moves according to the direction vector +9. After that, it follows another direction vector of -4. Where is Point A now?
    11

15. Point X is at 10. Point Y is at 30. Find the direction vector from X to Y and then subtract a vector of -5. What's the resultant vector?
    +15

16. If Point P1 is at 7 and Point P2 is at 19, calculate the halfway point between them using the method we covered.
    13

17. Calculate the halfway point between points 15 and 35.
    25

18. If the temperature changed from -5° to 10° between Monday to Tuesday and then from 10° to -3° from Tuesday to Wednesday, how much did the temperature change in total over the two days?
    2

19. Given that Point A is at 12, after applying vectors +7, +3, and -8 in sequence:
    a. Where is Point A?
    14
    b. What is the combined vector of these changes?
    +2

20. What do you get by subtracting 1 point from another?
    a direction vector that represents the change or difference
