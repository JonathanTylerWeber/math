vector = direction && magnitude/length

1. What is the main difference between a point and a vector?
   Answer: A point represents a position in space, while a vector represents both direction
   and magnitude.

2. True or False: Points and vectors are numerically represented by the same values.
   Answer: True.

3. What is the magnitude of a vector?
   Answer: The magnitude of a vector is its length or size.

4. What is the direction of a vector?
   Answer: The direction of a vector refers to the angle or orientation it points towards.

5. True or False: A vector can have a negative magnitude.
   Answer: False. Magnitude is always positive. The direction will handle making it
   negative or positive.
