Cartesian Coordinate System Questions

1. Define the Cartesian coordinate system in your own words.
   uses two perpendicular lines, an X-axis (horizontal) and a Y-axis (vertical), to define the location of any point on a
   plane as an ordered pair (X, Y)

2. Explain the purpose of the origin in the Cartesian coordinate system.
   The origin lets you know where the middle is

3. Describe the role of the axis in the Cartesian coordinate system.
   the axis is the line along which points exist

4. On a number line, what do positive and negative numbers represent?
   positions ahead of and behind the origin

5. What is the value halfway between 0 and 1 on the number line?
   0.5

6. Give an example of a real-world application where the Cartesian coordinate system could be used.
   they could be used to describe your position on a map

7. What is the significance of the origin in the context of the Cartesian coordinate system?
   it defines the middle point

8. Explain the difference between a point and a position vector in game development.
   theyre the same

9. Suppose you choose a position on the number line where the coordinate is -7. What does this represent in one-dimensional space?
   7 points to the left of the origin

10. How would you represent the point halfway between -5 and 2 on the number line?
    -1.5

11. Calculate the coordinate of the point that is three units to the right of the origin on the number line.
    3

12. Can a position on the number line have a fractional coordinate? Explain why or why not.
    yes in decimal

13. In game development, why is it important to accurately represent positions in space?
    games cant work if you dont know where things are

14. How would you represent the position of a player who is located two units to the left of the origin on the number line?
    A player located two units to the left of the origin on the number line would
    have a position with a coordinate of -2.

15. Suppose you have two positions on the number line: -3 and 7. Calculate the distance between these two points.
    The distance between -3 and 7 on the number line is 10 units.

16. Challenge: Given a position vector of -2.5, determine the position on the number line that is 1.5 units to the right of this vector.
    Given a position vector of -2.5, a point 1.5 units to the right of this vector
    would have a coordinate of -1
